# Sales Toolkit Dashboard

## Project Overview

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/0a256796-06c4-4c49-a3af-5f875f7a044c

A strategically designed sales toolkit dashboard specifically created for gymnastics program managers to enhance their sales performance and customer interactions. This application serves as a comprehensive training and reference platform that improves sales skills organically during real-time customer conversations.

## Project Goals & Purpose

### Primary Objectives
1. **Seamless Training Integration**: Design a tool that trains users naturally as they conduct sales calls, without interrupting their workflow or making training feel forced
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage ongoing skill development through easy access to proven sales strategies and best practices
3. **Real-Time Support**: Provide instant access to scripts, objection handling, and relevant information during live customer interactions
4. **Performance Consistency**: Standardize sales approaches across multiple locations while maintaining local flexibility

### Strategic Design Philosophy
- **Intuitive Learning**: Users improve their sales techniques unconsciously through regular interaction with the platform
- **Quick Reference**: All essential information accessible within seconds during calls
- **Location-Specific Customization**: Each of the 10 locations maintains separate, tailored content without cross-contamination
- **Single-Page Efficiency**: Eliminate navigation friction by consolidating all tools into one cohesive interface

- **Data Isolation**: Ensures one location's information doesn't interfere with another's operations

### User Experience Design
- **Single-Page Application**: All functionality accessible without page navigation
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized sections (Scripts, Tips, FAQs, Email Templates, Notes) for quick switching
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop use during phone calls, with mobile compatibility
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Strategic use of custom color palette (#b48f8f, #cec4c1, #8f93a0, #f9fafb, #b4acb0) for intuitive navigation
